# Design of EVE

A motivation of EVE is to avoid bifurcation of type logic except when huge performance of size efficiency can be accomplished. EVE could have included a small string tag, to save a byte for short strings, but this would have added complexity to the specification and it wouldn't have affected keys or strings within a typed array.
